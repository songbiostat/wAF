\title{wAF Combination}
\usage{
wAF_combine(p, log = FALSE, weight = NULL, n0 = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{P-values to be combined. A matrix with dimenstions K by N.
If an object of P-values from perm_score is used, K is the number
of SNVs, and N is the number of permutations plus 1.}

\item{log}{Indicator of whether P-values are on the log scale.}

\item{weight}{Weights given to the P-values. A vector with dimension
K. Flat weight is used if it is not specified.}

\item{n0}{Tuning parameter. Discard the first n0-1 P-values of each
column.}
}
\value{
A list object.
\describe{
  \item{pv}{P-value of wAF test.}
  \item{stat}{Observed test statitic of wAF test.}
  \item{stat_dist}{wAF test statistics for P-values in every column.}
  \item{SNV_combined}{Variants which are combined into the test
  statistic. The index of included variants are returned in the ascending
  order of their weighted P-values.}
}
}
\description{
This function combines P-values using
weighted adaptive Fisher (wAF) method.
}
\examples{
# Combine P-values of normally distributed test statistics
U <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 100), ncol=100)
p <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(U)))
wt <- (1:10)/55
test <- wAF_combine(p, weight = wt)


# Combine P-values from perm_score
Y <- SNV_sparse$trait
X <- SNV_sparse$SNV
result <- perm_score(Y, X, out = "all", nperm = 100)
test <- wAF_combine(result$pvs_2sided)
